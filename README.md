# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
This project is my final assignment for the Coursera course, where I focus on extracting and visualizing stock data for major companies, specifically Tesla and GameStop.

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized Python libraries to extract financial data and visualize it through informative graphs. The primary goals include:
- Extracting stock data for Tesla and GameStop using the yfinance library.
- Performing web scraping to gather revenue data for both companies.
- Plotting the stock performance graphs for Tesla and GameStop to analyze trends over time.

## Key features
- Stock Data Extraction:
  - Utilized the yfinance library to fetch historical stock prices and other relevant financial metrics for Tesla and GameStop.
- Web Scraping:
  - Employed web scraping techniques to extract Tesla's revenue data from financial websites.
  - Gathered GameStop's revenue data similarly using web scraping methods.
- Data Visualization:
  - Created visual representations of the stock data using Python plotting libraries, providing insights into stock performance and revenue trends.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for data extraction and visualization.
- **yfinance**: A library for accessing stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Used for web scraping to extract revenue data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating graphs and visualizations.
